# astro-bicocca

projects done during my Masters in bicocca.
1. lab of data aquicisition {To devise an Imaging and spectroscopic classification of the stars in the selected star cluster M103. First part of lab was aimed at drawing the color-magnitude diagram of the said star cluster by doing an analysis on the raw images obtained using the TOBI telescope. Later on we took spectropic data of the same cluster on one of the stars of the cluster , whereby we plotted its spectrum and tried to compute various properties of the star like its surface temperature and Redshift.}
   
2. lab of data analysis {This was my project on galaxy formation and evolution, where we developed models ranging from simple closed-box approaches to more complex open-box models. In this lab, we explored the intricate feedback processes of supernovae and the influence of gas inflow on the pristine gas reservoir. Moreover, we utilised data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to enhance our understanding and refine our models.}
   
3. Galaxies and dynamics{n-body simulation}
4.   
5. astrostatics and machine learning.{  }
